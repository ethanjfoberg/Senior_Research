# Assessing the Accuracy of AI Detection Tools in Differentiating Human from AI-Generated Creative Texts

This project evaluates the effectiveness of AI-generated text detection tools in identifying whether a creative passage was written by a human or generated by an AI model like ChatGPT-4o. The dataset includes human-written samples sourced from various news articles, as well as AI-generated texts made to mimic similar styles and genres. By analyzing the performance of multiple detection tools—including how well they handle obfuscated or deliberately altered AI content—this research aims to determine which tools are most accurate and reliable. The results will contribute to ongoing efforts to preserve the authenticity of creative and journalistic writing in an era of increasingly human-like AI outputs.
